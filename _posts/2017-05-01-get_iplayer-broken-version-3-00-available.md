<p>For those of us who make use of the amazing <code>get_iplayer</code> program to obtain clips and other resources for classroom and other conveniences, it comes as a bit of a blow to find that in the past week or two, it has stopped working. Fortunately, there is a new version of the program available that with a little effort, gets the facility working again.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/release300">the release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2017/05/g.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2349" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/g.png" alt="" width="285" height="115" /></a>The BBC removed all the XML-based data sources used by get_iplayer on 2017-04-26, breaking a lot of get_iplayer functionality. That functionality has been restored, but there are changes to be aware of - get_iplayer has not survived unscathed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Phil Lewis and the team have (once again) done a fantastic job of quickly responding to changes in the way the BBC delivers its content. Many, many thanks to all the devs and hacks involved in this release.</p>
<p>Finally, my advice to users is to read the release notes carefully. You may also hit issues installing the new dependencies including <a href="http://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious</a> and Perl as well as the <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">cpan perl repository</a>. Persevere, there is lots of useful advice out there. Finally, finally, the cache updates are much slower than before, although they are now only updated weekly.</p>
